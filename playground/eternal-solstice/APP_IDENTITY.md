# Is this a Windows App?

**YES.** 

Eternal Solstice is a **native Desktop Application** built specifically for **Windows 10 and 11**.

## 🛠️ Under the Hood
It uses **Electron** (the same technology powering **VS Code**, **Discord**, and **Slack**).
- **Why?** This allows us to create beautiful, modern UIs (Glassmorphism, animations) that standard Windows apps (C++/C#) struggle to do easily, while still having full access to your file system.
- **Optimization:** We are currently optimizing specifically for Windows file paths (`C:\`) and integration (OneDrive, etc.).

## 📦 Ready to Install?
Currently, we are running it in "Development Mode" (`npm start`).
**I can build a real `.exe` installer for you right now.**
This would allow you to:
1.  Install it like any other program.
2.  Pin it to your Taskbar.
3.  Set it as your default file explorer (eventually).

**Shall I build the installer `EternalSolstice_Setup.exe` now?**
